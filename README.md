### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Lizzy ðŸ˜„

Full Stack Software Engineer, Student at BloomTech

I am finishing up a 6 month coding bootcamp at BloomTech in May. We have learned all about CSS, HTML, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Cypress, Jest, and more!

Iâ€™m currently working on the frontend of a potluck app. This app will allow users to create events, invitations, and select items need for the potluck. I am exploring the ease and practicality of tailwind CSS during this project. I love it! 

Being a software engineer allows me to be creative in a way that my artistic abilities do not allow (because I only have a lack of traditional artistic abilities - ie singing or drawing). I love learning new technologies and be able to think in ways that are more innovative as I code. The creation process of building an application from scratch is amazing. I love how all of the pieces come together to generate a working product!
